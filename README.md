# Overview 
PyBer is a ride sharing app that operated around different cities. On this analysis, we will be preforming an exploratory analysis to have a better understanding of our customer, their location and dollars spend per ride and finally provide a business recommendation to the CEO. 

# Results 
 1) **Total Rides** [See result:](Resources/Fig6.png)
 
 The results provides us with more information about where does our customers use our the app the most. **More than half of our user are located on urban city with 68,4%**, followed by suburban cities with 26.3% and the type of city where is used the less is rural with 5.3%. 
 
 2) **Total Drivers** [See result:](Resources/Fig7.png)
 
 This result has a direct relationship with the total rides because drivers need to be located on those cities where the demand is. **Urban cities is where most of the driver are located with 80.9%**, followed by Suburban cities with 16.5%, last the rural cities.
 
 3) **Total Fares** [See result:](Resources/Fig5.png) 
 
 This analysis also has a direct relationship with the total Rides since the city types with most rides will have the largest percentage of fares. The result evidence 62.7% of the fares in Urban cities, followed by 30.5% on suburban cities and finally, 6.8% in Rural cities. 
 
 4) **Average Fare per ride** [See result:](Resources/Fig1.png)
 
 In this graph we can evaluate the average fare per city type and the circle size represents the how many types that fare repeats, with that information we can evidence the average price in Urban cities is around $24 repeating between 20 to 25 times per fare, compared to suburban cities where the average price is between $30 to $35 with a repetition of 15 to 20 times per fare.This previous two types of cities have a clear average, although, when we look closely to the average in rural cities the result are extremely disperse where the fares can go as low as $24 until above $40 per ride but the number of fares that repeats the most are in an average is around $35. 
 
 5)**Total Fare by city Type** [See result:](Resources/Pyber_fare_summary.png)\
 In this graph we analyzed the total fares per week between the dates of 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29, the highest income on urban cities is 2019-02-24 with $2466.29 and 2019-03-10 with $2470.93, in suburban cities we the highest income is on the week of 2019-02-24 with a value of $1412.74, finally on urban cities the highest income is on 2019-04-07 with $ 501.24. 
 
 Also, we encounter an overall trend on the week of 2019-02-24 on all cities, where we have a increase in total fares.
 
 # Recommendation 
 
The business recommendation will be to focus on the suburban areas since represent 30.5% of the income of the company and is achieved by having only 16.5% of the drivers. This area has an incredible potential because there is a demand for the service (Total rides 26.3%) and the pricing per ride in this area is higher (between $30 to $35) which translate to larger profits than the urban areas where there is a higher demand but lower price per ride.
